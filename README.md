See StaPLe.py and http://esolangs.org/wiki/StaPLe for full documentation.

Built for Python 3, minor changes to StaPLE.py will allow it to run on Python 2(I think):
  1. Change __next__(self) to next(self)
  2. Add from __future__ import print_function to the top of the file.
I haven't tried this yet so I will update once I do.
